                Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

            <h1>Docusaurus: Documentation Made Easy</h1>
            <p>In this presentation at Algolia Community Event, Meta Open Source team shared a brief walk-through of Docusaurus. They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging.</p>
            <h3>Migrating from v1</h3>
            <p>Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release, we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1, as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated.</p>
            <h4>Use Docusaurus v2+ if:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site</li>
                <li>‚úÖ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing</li>
                <li>‚úÖ You want the full power of React and MDX</li>
                <li>‚úÖ You do not need support for IE11</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Use Docusaurus v1 if:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> You don't want a single-page application (SPA)</li>
                <li>You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides.</p>

            <h1>Design Princpiles</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Little to learn. Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk‚ÄîMinimal API Surface Area.</li>
            <li>Intuitive. Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with.</li>
            <li>Layered architecture. The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear‚Äîwell-abstracted and modular.</li>
            <li>Sensible defaults. Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them.</li>
            <li>No vendor lock-in. Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="compare">
            <h1>Comparison with other tools</h1>
            <p>Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.</p>
            <p>We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there.</p>
            <h2>Gatsby</h2>
            <p>Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.</p>
            <p>GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.</p>
            <p>Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative.</p>
            <p>Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.</p>
            <h2>Next.js</h2>
            <p>Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box.</p>
            <p>Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.</p>
            <h2>VuePress</h2>
            <p>VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.</p>
            <h2>MkDocs</h2>
            <p>MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus.

                It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React.
                
                Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme.</p>
                <h2>GitBook</h2>
                <p>GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here.

                    Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.</p>
